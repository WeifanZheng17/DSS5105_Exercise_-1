# Checkerboard Pattern Generator

## Description
This project generates a synthetic grayscale checkerboard image using Python. It demonstrates basic image generation techniques with NumPy and Matplotlib. The script is part of a take-home exercise for learning Git and GitHub workflows.

## Features
- Generates a checkerboard pattern of customizable size and number of squares.
- Displays the generated image using Matplotlib.
- Includes version control setup with Git and GitHub.

## Installation
- Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Required the following Python libraries: numpy and matplotlib

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Steps to Run the Script
- Download the Repository:
  Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/WeifanZheng17/DSS5105_Exercise_-1.git.
  Click on the green Code button and select Download ZIP.
  Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.
- Navigate to the Project Folder:
  Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted folder:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/extracted-folder
  ```
- Run the Python Script:
  Execute the script to generate and display the checkerboard pattern:
  ```bash
  python checkerboard.py
  ```

## Git Workflow
This repository follows a basic Git workflow:
1. Initialize a local Git repository.
2. Make changes and commit.
3. Create a remote repository on GitHub.
4. Connect the local repository to GitHub.
5. Push the code to GitHub.
6. (Bonus) Experiment with branching and colormap modifications.
