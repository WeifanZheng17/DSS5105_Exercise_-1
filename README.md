# Checkerboard Pattern Generator

## Description
This project generates a synthetic grayscale checkerboard image using Python. It demonstrates basic image generation techniques with NumPy and Matplotlib. The script is part of a take-home exercise for learning Git and GitHub workflows.

## Features
- Generates a checkerboard pattern of customizable size and number of squares.
- Displays the generated image using Matplotlib.
- Includes version control setup with Git and GitHub.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the `checkerboard.py` script to generate and display the checkerboard image:

```bash
python checkerboard.py
```

## Git Workflow
This repository follows a basic Git workflow:
1. Initialize a local Git repository.
2. Make changes and commit.
3. Create a remote repository on GitHub.
4. Connect the local repository to GitHub.
5. Push the code to GitHub.
6. (Bonus) Experiment with branching and colormap modifications.
